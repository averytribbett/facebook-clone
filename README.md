To run on your machine:
1) install Node.js if you have not already
2) install angular with this command: npm install -g @angular/cli (I'm assuming this is the same for mac?)
3) install Go language
4) using the terminal, cd (unsure mac equivalent) into the Frontend folder and run these commands:
    a) ng build
    b) ng serve
    note: if you get weird errors, I might try running "npm install"
5) cd into the Backend folder
6) run this command: go run main.go
7) go to localhost:3000 (if it doesn't show up try localhost:3000/api)
