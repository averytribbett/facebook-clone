Ideas for project structure:

-Home handler / service:
    -when user logs in it brings them to home page
    -endpoints could include:
        -getUserFeed (returns all posts in chronological order from friend list)
        -getUserProfilePhoto (returns user photo, if we get to that)
        -createNewPost (when user creates a new posts it adds it to the feed)
        -deletePost ?
        -createNewReply (adds a reply to a post)

Profile handler / service:
    -getUserPosts
    -createNewPost
    -deletePost ?
    -addFriend (for when user is looking at a profile that is not their own)
    -deleteFriend (again for a different profile)

Login handler / service:
    -login / logout functionality, with Auth0? Not sure if this happens primarily on frontend or backend

Commonalities:
    -create / delete post could probably be same endpoint regardless if user is looking at their own profile or their entire
    friend feed (it might have to be different but would be nice to share)
    -login / logout could happen on any page

Questions:
1. How to ensure users are redirected to login page if they try to type in a URL that requires a login?
